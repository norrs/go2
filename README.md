# Go2

Small standalone webserver application for creating memorable URI forwarders.

Just like bit.ly etc.

## Requirements

* Redis (Go2 uses redis as a simple backend for storinng the forwarders on it's identifier.)

## Building requirements

* Bazel (build system) - http://bazel.io
* JDK8
* Internet access to download JAR artifacts :')

## Important TODO

* Fix LICENSE and NOTICE files. (need to define licenses on third-party libraries etc)
* Choose a LICENSE that suits using all the libraries that I'm already using.

## Some notes

Be free to take a peak around if you are curious about bazel.
This project still has quite a few things left to do, ie ensuring all proper NOTICE and Copyright files are as they should.
This is basically one of my playground project for getting to know bazel better.
